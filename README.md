#  The Space Shooter - Game Design
This is a game where you play the role of a spacecraft and shoot as many enemy ships as possible without colliding into an enemy ship.

## Movement 
- The player can move the spacecraft up, down, left, or right using the up, down, left, right arrow keys.
- The enemy ships appear at random positions throughout the game.

## Scores 
- A player collects points as he/she shoots the enemyships. 
- Each shot is worth 5 points, so to win shoot as many enemy ships as possible.

## Game Over 
- The game ends when the player's spacecraft collides into an enemy ship. 
- The score is saved and can be viewed on the scoreboard. 
- The player is prompted to retry to play the game again.

## Future additions 
In the future, I will try to enhance the game by
- Increasing the speed of the spaceship.
- Adding more variety of enemy ships.
- Granting more than one life to the player in the game.
